# Handwritten Digit Classifier using Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the **scikit-learn digits dataset**. It trains the model, evaluates accuracy, and visualizes results with a confusion matrix heatmap.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* Loads the built-in `digits` dataset from `scikit-learn`.
* Uses Logistic Regression for classification.
* Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
* Displays model accuracy.
* Visualizes results with a confusion matrix heatmap using Seaborn.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python digits_classifier.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

* **Model Accuracy:** \~96â€“98% (varies slightly per run)
* **Confusion Matrix Heatmap** showing classification performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains **1,797 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (8Ã—8 pixels), with labels from 0â€“9.

Do you want me to also **add image samples of predicted results** to this README so it looks more visually appealing on GitHub? That would make it stand out.
